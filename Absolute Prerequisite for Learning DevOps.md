**Business Analyst (BA)** (6:17): This role acts as a bridge between the business (marketing, sales) and the customers. BAs interact with customers to gather requirements and prepare Business Requirements Documents (BRDs).


**Product Manager (PM)** (8:11): Product Managers prioritize the requirements gathered by Business Analysts, aligning them with product vision and organizational capabilities. They are not highly technical.

**Product Owner (PO)** (9:16): The Product Owner delves deeper into the technical aspects of the requirements, breaking down high-level requirements into actionable items called epics or features. They manage the product backlog.

**Solutions Architect/Software Architect (SA)** (10:43): Solutions Architects are highly technical and interact with Product Owners to define the low-level design (LLD) and high-level design (HLD) for the implementation of features. They also assess the feasibility of requirements based on available skills and expertise.

**Development Teams/Developers** (12:56): These are the individuals responsible for implementing the features based on the designs provided by Solution Architects. They identify infrastructure and operational needs to complete their tasks.

**DevOps Engineers** (13:58): DevOps Engineers receive requirements from developers (and sometimes solution architects) to provide necessary infrastructure, automation, and tools (e.g., Kubernetes clusters, Docker files, Git repositories). They also work to identify and improve inefficiencies in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) (24:00).

**QA Engineers** (14:32): Quality Assurance Engineers are responsible for testing the features developed by the development team to ensure they meet quality standards.

**Database Administrator (DBA)** (14:38): DBAs are responsible for setting up and administering databases required for the applications.

**SRE Engineers (Site Reliability Engineers)** (16:19): SREs are primarily responsible for the reliability and availability of the live product or feature. They monitor performance, create dashboards and metrics, and set up alerts for issues.

**Technical Writer** (16:54): Technical Writers document new features and product information, ensuring users understand how to use and interact with the software.

**Jira**

- Jira is a work allocation tool provided in the organisation to track the records of the work that is assigned to a team member.

- The speaker explains Jira as a popular project management tool (1:51) used to track and manage work within an organization. He highlights its importance for:

**Project Management Visibility** (2:00): Jira allows management to track the entire project, understand the status of specific tasks, and see who is accountable for what (26:09-27:28).

**Tracking Work Progress** (26:16): It provides visibility into individual tasks, such as a DevOps engineer working on a Kubernetes cluster or a QA engineer testing a feature (26:21).

**Identifying Blockers** (26:34): Jira helps identify if a task is blocked due to budget, technical issues, or lack of expertise, and how that impacts the overall project and stakeholders (26:46).

**Workflow Integration** (25:56): It serves as a platform where the various roles (Product Owners, Developers, DevOps Engineers) can input and track their work.

**Epic and Story Creation** (31:00): Product Owners create "epics" (large features), which are then broken down into smaller "stories" by the development team during sprint planning (34:55).

**Assignment of Tasks** (38:19): Specific stories, like "create a Kubernetes cluster," are assigned to relevant team members, such as a DevOps engineer (39:19).

**Status Updates** (40:51): Team members are responsible for updating the status of their tasks (e.g., "to do," "in progress," "in review," "done") and adding comments on their progress (40:59).

- explained about roles in the organization
- did jira installations, created organization, epic 
- within agile a framework called scrum is followed, temas work in sprints
   - 2 or 3 weeks work are tracked part of sprint
   - epic will be broken into stories
