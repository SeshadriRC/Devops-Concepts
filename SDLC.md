- Above are the SDLC standard all organizations should follow

- If in case E-commerce app need to introduce new feature called **kids section**, before it selling only for **Mens-section**

**1. Planning-Phase**

- In the planning phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), the primary focus is on gathering requirements (9:45). This is considered a fundamental starting stage where product owners, business analysts, and senior team members collect input from customers (10:07).

- The goal is to understand customer needs and determine if a proposed feature or product is genuinely useful and desired (10:37-10:53). For example, if an e-commerce website is considering adding a "kids' section," they would gather data on customer interest in various age ranges for kids' clothing (11:10-11:32). This information helps in deciding whether to proceed with the idea or suspend it at this early stage, avoiding wasted effort in later phases (10:55-11:00).

**2. Defining-Phase**

- The defining phase is where the gathered requirements are clearly documented (11:38). For example, a product owner or business analyst would write a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document (12:17) that includes all the data collected during the planning stage.

**3. Designing-Phase**

The designing phase is a crucial stage where high-level design (HLD) and low-level design (LLD) are created (12:31-12:39).

- High-Level Design (HLD): Architects or senior resources define the overall system architecture, focusing on aspects like scalability and high availability. This includes decisions on databases and the number of application replicas (13:16-13:27).

- Low-Level Design (LLD): Senior members of the development team design the system in detail, specifying particular functions, modules, database calls (e.g., MySQL), and the arguments/responses for function calls (13:28-14:12).

***********************************************************

The phases of SDLC that are considered DevOps-centric or where a DevOps engineer should be primarily interested are (14:55):

Building the software (developing) (15:50-16:00, 16:23-17:17)
Testing the software (16:00-16:02, 18:48-19:20)
Deploying the software (16:02-16:10, 19:26-19:57)
A DevOps engineer's main goal in these phases is to automate the processes to improve efficiency and reduce manual intervention (20:58-21:10, 22:50-23:04).
