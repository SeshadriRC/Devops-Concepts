**Planning-Phase**

- In the planning phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), the primary focus is on gathering requirements (9:45). This is considered a fundamental starting stage where product owners, business analysts, and senior team members collect input from customers (10:07).

- The goal is to understand customer needs and determine if a proposed feature or product is genuinely useful and desired (10:37-10:53). For example, if an e-commerce website is considering adding a "kids' section," they would gather data on customer interest in various age ranges for kids' clothing (11:10-11:32). This information helps in deciding whether to proceed with the idea or suspend it at this early stage, avoiding wasted effort in later phases (10:55-11:00).
