**1. What is Devops ?**
   
- DevOps is a culture or practice that an organization adopts to improve its ability to deliver applications quickly. It aims to reduce the time it takes to release new versions or updates, ideally from days to hours or even minutes.

- In essence, DevOps is a process that focuses on improving application delivery by ensuring proper automation, maintaining code quality, continuous monitoring, and continuous testing. The ultimate goal for a DevOps engineer is to eliminate manual processes and accelerate application delivery.

**2. Why Devops**

- To improve the process of application delivery

Before 10 years, in the traditional software delivery process, the following roles were involved (16:59-17:18):

- System Administrator (16:36-16:39): This role was responsible for creating servers. These servers were necessary for testing applications, as testing couldn't be reliably done on a personal laptop in an organizational setting. Before cloud platforms like AWS were prevalent, they used technologies like VMware or OpenStack, or even bare metals with hypervisors like Xen, to create servers.

- Build and Release Engineer: Once the developer checked in their code to a centralized code repository (like SVN or CBS), the build and release engineer would deploy the application onto the server. After a tester had tested the application on a server, this engineer would then promote the application to the next level, such as a staging environment or finally to the production server (15:51-16:17).

- Server Administrator: This role was responsible for creating and managing the application server (19:01-19:07) that would host the application on the newly created server.

**3. How to introduce as a Devops**

Got it 👍 I’ll **keep the previous strong infra-focused version** and just **add a clean opening line** about your DevOps foundation—clear, professional, and not repetitive.



### **Final Interview-Ready Introduction (Aligned to Infra Role)**

> Hi, I’m Seshadri. I initially started my career as a DevOps Engineer and built a strong foundation with core DevOps tools and practices.
>
> I have around 6 years of experience and currently focus on managing and supporting infrastructure on cloud-native and containerized platforms. In my current role, all infrastructure components such as S3, RDS, RabbitMQ, and other platform services are provisioned through Kubernetes operators on OpenShift.
>
> My primary responsibility is to handle infrastructure-related issues during provisioning and lifecycle operations. Whenever customers face issues, I troubleshoot operator workflows, custom resources, controller logs, and underlying cloud or platform dependencies to identify and resolve the problems.
