**DevOps engineers** typically work on multiple projects within an organization and are responsible for a variety of tasks, which are usually managed through project management tools like Jira (3:18). 
They receive requests from different development teams (2:29-3:12) and prioritize these tasks using agile methodology, often with the help of a scrum master and product owner (4:48-6:07).

Common day-to-day tasks for a DevOps engineer include:

**Infrastructure Provisioning:** Creating and managing infrastructure, such as setting up Kubernetes clusters (2:34, 7:07) or creating AWS resources like EC2 instances and S3 buckets using Terraform (2:48-3:02, 8:43-8:51).
